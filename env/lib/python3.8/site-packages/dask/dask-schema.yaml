properties:
  temporary-directory:
    type:
    - string
    - "null"
    description: |
      Temporary directory for local disk storage /tmp, /scratch,
      or /local.  This directory is used during dask spill-to-disk operations.

      When the value is "null" (default), dask will create a directory from
      where dask was launched: `cwd/dask-worker-space`

  dataframe:

    properties:

      shuffle-compression:
        type:
        - string
        - "null"
        description: |
          Compression algorithm used for on disk-shuffling. Partd, the library used
          for compression supports ZLib, BZ2, SNAPPY, and BLOSC

        properties:

          size:
            type: integer
            description: |
              The size of pixels used when displaying a dask array as an SVG image.
              This is used, for example, for nice rendering in a Jupyter notebook

        properties:

          active:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              Configuration setting to turn task fusion on/off

          ave-width:
            type: integer
            description: |
              Upper limit for width, where width = num_nodes / height, a good measure
              of parallelizability

          subraphs:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              Configuration setting to control whether to fuse multiple tasks into
              SubgraphCallable objects.

          rename-keys:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              Configuration setting to control renaming of the fused keys with
              `default_fused_keys_renamer` or not. Renaming fused keys can keep the
              graph more understandable and comprehensive, but it comes at the cost of
              additional processing. If False, then the top-most key will be used. For
              advanced usage, a function to create the new name is also accepted.
